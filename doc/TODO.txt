Develop simple console utility to prompt password (with optional re-enter
for confirmation) for smoother repo init if one doesn't exists before backup,
or for batch directory list processing.
See: https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/05/04/

Implement new "batch" command to perform backup processing for all directories
listed in à specified file.

Rename all internal vars with unique prefix to mitigate risk of name conflicts
with environment and/or external variables.

Get rid of risk of logging issues if there is the LOG_FILE variable (or similar
after internal var renaming as suggested in another point of this TODO) already
exists in the system or caller's environment.
